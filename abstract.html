<div>We apply the Momentum-First (M-First) framework, in which gravity directly modifies a&nbsp;<span style="background-color: inherit;">particle's fundamental momentum relation, to derive the governing quantum operator for a</span></div><div>fermion in stationary spacetimes. The resulting unified core momentum operator, </div><div>$\hat{M}_g$, is constructed from first principles, and its structure is uniquely fixed </div><div>by the spacetime's symmetries, containing no free parameters. In the static limit, the </div><div>operator's scalar component—the contextual fermic momentum—provides a quantitative, </div><div>parameter-free resolution to the neutron star shallow heating puzzle by enhancing </div><div>quantum tunneling rates. The operator's vectorial component, sourced by spacetime </div><div>rotation, gives rise to novel, falsifiable spin-gravity couplings, including a </div><div>gravitational spin-Hall effect. The ability of this single operator to resolve a </div><div>persistent anomaly while predicting new, testable phenomena demonstrates the predictive </div><div>power and internal consistency of the M-First paradigm.</div>
