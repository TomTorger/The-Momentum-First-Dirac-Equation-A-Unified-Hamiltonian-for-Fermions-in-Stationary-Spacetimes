<div>The Momentus uniquely determined by the spacetime's isometry group and the correspondence principle, containing no free parameters. In its static limit, it resolves the neutron star shallow heating puzzle via a gravitationally induced contextual mass. In its rotational limit, it provides the theoretical foundation for the anomalous Earth fly-by velocity shifts. The theory further predicts novel, testable phenomena, including a gravitational spin-Hall effect and a gravitational screening of charge. The ability of a single, coherent framework to solve existing anomalies and predict new physics marks it as a compelling paradigm for quantum-gravity interactions.</div>
